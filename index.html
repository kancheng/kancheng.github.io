The Impacts of China’s Deleveraging on the Chinese Economy (Jan 2019 – Dec 2019)
	Description: This research first used the DSGE model to analyze the volatility of China's total output value, annual interest rate, and inflation rate for the overall economy of China from 1992 to 2017. Then, using the VAR, it found that the deleveraging of non-financial enterprises had short-term negative impacts on the overall economic growth rate, which would decrease with time. In the long run, the deleveraging of non-financial enterprises had minimal impacts on the overall economic growth rate. 
	Keywords: Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE), Vector Autoregression Model (VAR), macroeconomics, deleveraging, business cycle, Basel III, shadow banking system, H-P filter
